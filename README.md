A Python implementation of the intermediate E9S12 floating-point format and a double-word decomposition method from FP32 to E9S12 based on "Double-Word Decomposition in a Combined FP16,
BF16 and FP32 Dot Product Add Operator" by Desrentes, de Dinechin & de Dinechin.

- `implementation.py` is the full script featuring the tests
- `output.txt` is the output of the script.

We can see that the FP32 numbers are reconstructed exactly.
